Things are changing now, hopefully for the better. Majority of pilots left in QH are still working together, all under one roof now though. Hope to see you all out there.

Unfortunately however it would appear that as a collective we are being devoured by that most horrendous of dangerous of creatures, the drama llama.<br><br>Silent, uncaring and malicious this foul beast lurks in the wings of corporations and alliances alike. Armed with an Axe of Paranoia +1 in one hoof and a Vorpal Spork in the other 12 it seeks to shatter and destroy the unity and comradeship of our group as a whole for nothing more than its own petty glee.<br><br>As such I’m proposing the institution of the Fly Reckless Patriot act. All members are now forbidden from feeding the drama llama. Anyone in coercion with the drama llama shall be handed over to the ministering of our resident South African Tumbles Goodness. As well all know he can do a camp German accent better than anyone alive and by proxy I assume that he has ways to make you talk. I've already ordered a comfy chair and a fluffy pillow, his official red robes and inquisitor cross will arrive shortly after.<br><br>All alliance and corporation members will be subject to mind scans by means of telepathic house cat. over the next few days and the results shall promptly be provided to the all high space Giga-pope, who as we all know is the shark the size of a horse with the appearance of a badger, and it's infallible judgement shall be rendered to the defence against drama llama sub-commissar for confirmation of infallibility, before being provided to the shadow senate of the 12th moon of qwazzock for spell checking. BEFORE being handed to the holy-moly-bo-boly-fannana-nana-fo-foely-Gee-Aye-Go-Goaly chief justice of Mxyzptlk.... then shredded for reasons of internal security<br><br>In the mean time while investigations are underway the “holygrail” protocol shall be observed. “GET ON WITH IT”<br><br>on a more serious note: yeah, shit's happened folks but it seems that we're basking in our drama a bit, i might be wrong, but I'm a shameless attention seeker and this is the perfect excuse for me to deal with this caffeine high. While the temptations of the drama llama are at times comforting. Letting the drama get the best of us is only going to result in a phail cascade, which I’ll recite on the podcast for attention and “woe is me” sympathy, media whore that I am. If we really want to reforge the group as a whole I would suggest that our best means of doing so is to get our operations and actions rolling again regularly and effectively. Now I could go on a long speil of churchill quotes or maybe indulge in some Sun-Tzu but I have to admit, it would seem a little bit trite. I've always been a bit more of a Babylon 5 fan when it comes to this kind of thing so I'll leave you a quote from that manly man's man Michael Garibaldi.<br><br>"And what kind of head of Security would I be if I let people like me know things that I'm not supposed to know?<br>I mean, I know what I know because I have to know it. And if I don't have to know it, I don't tell me, and I don't let anyone else tell me either...<br>try never to get involved in my own life. Too much trouble."<br><br>the Telepathic House cat shall be with you shortly.<br><br>- For the honour of the Shark-horse-badger giga-pope.

This has led to an unnecessarily large amount of drama.  I do not like drama.  <br><br>Here is what I would like to propose.<br><br>We are getting derailed on a lot of things pertaining to the idea behind a single corporation.  The idea itself is a good one, it allows us to share common bookmarks, corp chats, and even technology (a little project I am working on).<br><br>So, I would like to start a back and forth conversation with everyone, see if we can get some things worked out, and figure out where to go from here.  This is an open evemail that I would like everyone to respond to with ideas and suggestions.  <br><br>I am going to throw my thoughts out here, please feel free to respond with what you think.  If we hope to make this work, then it needs to include everyones voice.<br><br>First and formost, I talked to Dave today, and found the idea that he had VERY refreshing, and it helped to avoid much of the drama that has been happening here.  <br><br>I propose, based on Dave's idea, that we form a single corporation that remains in the alliance.  The single corporation would only include those LIVING IN THE C5.<br><br>Here is how I would propose the leadership working:<br><br>CEO - Hansolo1977<br>Director - Pflepsen<br>Director - Varos Kang<br><br>Now, there is a reason to this madness.  A large point of contention has been the idea that if we have 4 directors, and 1 CEO, 1 or 2 corporations will ALWAYS have more representation then the others.<br><br>I view this single corporation as more of a "confederation" to start.  It would be something we park our toons in to get things done while living in the C5, and we would always have our old corporations to go back to.  I propose this setup because I do not think all 3 corps will ever agree on who should be the leaders.<br><br>I also think that having a fallback (ie we can always rejoin our old corporations if we don't like what is happening), is essential to this working.<br><br>I do NOT want to get bogged down in details.. That should be something that the 3 leaders work out after (or if) we agree that this is the way to go.  The idea behind this setup is equal power... how so you ask?  <br><br>Initially there will be 999 shares in the corporation.  These shares will be split 3 ways.<br><br>333 - Hansolo<br>333 - Pflepsen<br>333 - Varos<br><br>This keeps a balance of power that allows no 1 person to take total control of the group (ie the CEO removing director roles, because the 2 directors with shares can then oust him).<br><br>PLEASE let me know what you think of this idea.  Please hit "reply all" when responding to this, this way we can get a conversation going.<br><br>TL:DR:<br><br>1 "confederation" corporation, basically a "temporary corp" for doing all of our WH shit.<br><br>Equal power between 3 leaders from the 3 corps in the alliance.<br><br>If this is agreed on, the 3 of them can determine how roles, etc will be split, BEFORE anyone moves in.<br><br>==============<br><br><br>I believe we are getting caught up in the details, and it is not productive. I believe that power for the purpose of power is not only dangerous, but it is a cancer.  Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely.  I want to see power in the hands of those who have earned it, and who have had it, and not abused it, before.<br><br><br>PLEASE let me know your thoughts.<br><br>Thanks, and much love as always,<br><br>Andy</font>]]></row>

This has led to an unnecessarily large amount of drama.  I do not like drama.  <br><br>Here is what I would like to propose.<br><br>We are getting derailed on a lot of things pertaining to the idea behind a single corporation.  The idea itself is a good one, it allows us to share common bookmarks, corp chats, and even technology (a little project I am working on).<br><br>So, I would like to start a back and forth conversation with everyone, see if we can get some things worked out, and figure out where to go from here.  This is an open evemail that I would like everyone to respond to with ideas and suggestions.  <br><br>I am going to throw my thoughts out here, please feel free to respond with what you think.  If we hope to make this work, then it needs to include everyones voice.<br><br>First and formost, I talked to Dave today, and found the idea that he had VERY refreshing, and it helped to avoid much of the drama that has been happening here.  <br><br>I propose, based on Dave's idea, that we form a single corporation that remains in the alliance.  The single corporation would only include those LIVING IN THE C5.<br><br>Here is how I would propose the leadership working:<br><br>CEO - Hansolo1977<br>Director - Pflepsen<br>Director - Varos Kang<br><br>Now, there is a reason to this madness.  A large point of contention has been the idea that if we have 4 directors, and 1 CEO, 1 or 2 corporations will ALWAYS have more representation then the others.<br><br>I view this single corporation as more of a "confederation" to start.  It would be something we park our toons in to get things done while living in the C5, and we would always have our old corporations to go back to.  I propose this setup because I do not think all 3 corps will ever agree on who should be the leaders.<br><br>I also think that having a fallback (ie we can always rejoin our old corporations if we don't like what is happening), is essential to this working.<br><br>I do NOT want to get bogged down in details.. That should be something that the 3 leaders work out after (or if) we agree that this is the way to go.  The idea behind this setup is equal power... how so you ask?  <br><br>Initially there will be 999 shares in the corporation.  These shares will be split 3 ways.<br><br>333 - Hansolo<br>333 - Pflepsen<br>333 - Varos<br><br>This keeps a balance of power that allows no 1 person to take total control of the group (ie the CEO removing director roles, because the 2 directors with shares can then oust him).<br><br>PLEASE let me know what you think of this idea.  Please hit "reply all" when responding to this, this way we can get a conversation going.<br><br>TL:DR:<br><br>1 "confederation" corporation, basically a "temporary corp" for doing all of our WH shit.<br><br>Equal power between 3 leaders from the 3 corps in the alliance.<br><br>If this is agreed on, the 3 of them can determine how roles, etc will be split, BEFORE anyone moves in.<br><br>==============<br><br><br>I believe we are getting caught up in the details, and it is not productive. I believe that power for the purpose of power is not only dangerous, but it is a cancer.  Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely.  I want to see power in the hands of those who have earned it, and who have had it, and not abused it, before.<br><br><br>PLEASE let me know your thoughts.<br><br>Thanks, and much love as always,<br><br>Andy</font>]]></row>
