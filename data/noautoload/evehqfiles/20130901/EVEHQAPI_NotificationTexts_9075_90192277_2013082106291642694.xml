  to join Conquering Darkness.<br><br>I've been playing EVE on and off since 2007
  with sometime spent in 0.0 with Dark Matter Coalition and Atlas (where I got blown
  up a lot by RED and then Goonswarm). Most recently I've been soloing playing in
  High sec with mining and production. While I don't necessarily mind the mining etc
  I'd rather be part of a group rather than playing solo. <br><br>Skills can be found
  at http://eveboard.com/pilot/Hokosaki I also have an alt Kainko who will probably
  end up staying in high sec to buy and move more pvp ships for Hokosaki when I inevitably
  get my ass blown up.<br><br>Happy to add more if required, will feel pretty stupid
  if only Gynax reads this.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Hokosaki
